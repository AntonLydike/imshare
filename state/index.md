# Imshare

Statically hosted image sharing with zero tracking.

This is a no-bullshit approach to image sharing. Images are hosted on my server and my server only. Each share has a unique link and is not accessible without it. Shares are deleted when they get too old or space runs out. Check out [the repository](https://github.com/antonlydike/imshare) if you want to know more.
